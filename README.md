This is a webapp that allows users to register, recieving an API key. Once they recieved it, they can send a POST request to "/api/<API_KEY>" with the required JSON keys. This will add their data to a DB, and once they return to the website it will now display their data plotted on a beautiful graph.

I made this to save time for my fellow students who need to plot our alghorithms speed for our project writeups.

P.S no warm blankets ;)
